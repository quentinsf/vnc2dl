=======================================================================

Background
----------

Vnc2dl is heavily based on TightVNC Viewer version 1.3.10, which in turn
is based on the standard VNC source and includes TightVNC-specific features 
and fixes, such as additional low-bandwidth optimizations, major GUI 
improvements, and more.

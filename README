standard VNC source released by RealVNC Ltd and AT&T Labs Cambridge.

There are two programs here:

	vnc2dl - this is a VNC viewer which outputs to a DisplayLink device
	        instead of to the desktop.
	        
	vncpasswd - this program allows you to change the password used to
		    access your X VNC desktops.  It creates a password file which
		    vnc2dl might one day be able to use!

First you must have at least some parts of X installed because vnc2dl still uses some of the X build utilities.
Also, the TightVNC components require JPEG and zlib libraries installed in the system 
(e.g. under /usr/local)
You'll need the DisplayLink libdlo library installed, and this also requires a recent libusb.  

On Ubuntu 10.04, I had to do:

   sudo aptitude install xutils-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libjpeg62 libjpeg62-dev libusb-dev

to pull in some of the dependencies.


To build everything, do:

	% xmkmf
	% make World

This should build the vncauth library which is used by each of the programs, 
then vnc2dl and vncpasswd.

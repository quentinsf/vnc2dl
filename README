There are five programs here:

	vnc2dl - this is a VNC viewer which outputs to a DisplayLink device
	        instead of to the desktop.
	        
	vncviewer - this is the VNC viewer, or client, program for X.

	vncserver - this is a wrapper script which makes starting an X VNC
		    server (i.e. desktop) more convenient.  It is written in
		    Perl, so to use the script you need that.

	vncpasswd - this program allows you to change the password used to
		    access your X VNC desktops.  The vncserver script uses
		    this program when you first start a VNC server.

	vncconnect - this program tells a running instance of Xvnc to connect
		     to a listening VNC viewer (normally the connection is made
		     the other way round i.e. the viewer connects to Xvnc).



First you must have a reasonably recent version of X installed (this includes
/usr/openwin on Solaris machines).  Also, TightVNC requires JPEG and zlib
libraries installed in the system (e.g. under /usr/local), and the DisplayLink
libdlo library requires a recent libusb to be installed.  To build
everything, do:

    % cd vnc2dl/libdlo
    % ./configure && make
    % cd ../..
	% xmkmf
	% make World

This should build first the libdlo library for communication with DisplayLink
hardware, then then vncauth library which is used by each of the programs, 
then vnc2dl, vncviewer, vncpasswd and vncconnect.

If it all builds OK you should copy the programs to some directory which
is in your PATH environment variable, such as /usr/local/bin.  Also, it's
handy to install manual pages in a directory where the man utility can find
them.  You can use the vncinstall script to do this for you (man path is
optional):

	% cd ..
	% ./vncinstall /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man

If you want to use the Java VNC viewer, you should copy the class files from
the classes directory to some suitable installation directory such as
/usr/local/vnc/classes:

	% mkdir -p /usr/local/vnc/classes
	% cp classes/* /usr/local/vnc/classes

We recommend that you use the vncserver script to run Xvnc for you.  You can
edit the script as appropriate for your site.  Things you may need to change
include:

 * The location of Perl - if Perl is not installed in /usr/bin you'll need
   to edit the "#!/usr/bin/perl" first line of vncserver.

 * $vncClasses - this specifies the location of the Java classes for
   the VNC viewer applet.  The default is /usr/local/vnc/classes.

 * Xvnc's font path and color database.  If you have an installation of
   X which is not in the standard place you may need to add arguments to the
   Xvnc command line to set these.  These should be appended to the $cmd
   variable at the comment "# Add font path and color database...".

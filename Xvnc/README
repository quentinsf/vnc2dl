=======================
Xvnc - the VNC X server
=======================

This is the top level directory for Xvnc, the VNC X server (or the X VNC
server, depending on how you look at it).

It is based on the XFree86 3.3.2 "server only" distribution, which in turn is
based on the X11R6.3 distribution from the X consortium.

To build Xvnc, simply do "make World" in this directory.  If the build is
successful, the binary will be left in programs/Xserver.

If you have trouble building you may need to play around with the imake
configuration files in the directory config/cf.  Read the X consortium files
RELNOTES.TXT and INSTALL.TXT.  Also see the file config/cf/vnc.def for
information specific to Xvnc.

The code specific to the TightVNC X server is located in the
programs/Xserver/hw/vnc directory.  The rest of the code is a cut-down
version of the standard XFree86 distribution without many of the later
X extensions or hardware-specific code.  See the file DIFFS for details
of all changes made to files from the XFree86 distribution.
